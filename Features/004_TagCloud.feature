Feature: Viewing tag cloud
  As a Visitor
  I want to use a tag cloud
  So I could easily find topics I am interested in

  Background:
    Given site has users:
      | login | password | email               | url                 | display_name |
      | admin | 121212   | jakub+spam@zalas.pl | http://www.zalas.eu | Jakub Zalas  |
    And site has tags:
      | tag      |
      | symfony  |
      | Symfony2 |
      | php      |
      | nginx    |
      | ubuntu   |
      | doctrine |
      | config   |
    And site has categories:
      | tag      |
      | Default  |
      | capifony |
      | symfony  |
    And site has blog posts:
      | type     | status  | title | slug  | published_at    | user_login | excerpt | content  | tags | categories |

  Scenario: Only active tags are visible
     When I go to /blog
     Then I should see "3 posts tagged with symfony"
      And I should see "2 posts tagged with nginx"
      And I should see "One post tagged with capifony"
      And I should see "One post tagged with php"
      And I should see "One post tagged with ubuntu"
      And I should see "One post tagged with doctrine"
      But I should not see "tagged with Symfony2"
      And I should not see "tagged with config"
      And I should not see "tagged with Default"
